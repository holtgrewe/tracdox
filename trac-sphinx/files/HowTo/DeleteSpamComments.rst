How To: Delete Spam Comments
----------------------------

For Admins.

We now have a plugin installed that allows the deletion of changes to
tickets, including comments. The main problem now is that that some
tickets get a **lot** of spam:

If you click on the *delete* button next to a comment, you will be
directed to a page that allows the bulk deletion of comments via check
boxes. If there is a *lot* of spam then the following process might
simplify spam removal. First, get
`CheckFox <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2393>`__, a
Firefox plugin that allows to check all check boxes in the select
region.

Then, when seeing a ticket with a lot of spam:

#. Click *delete* button next to comment.

| ``2. Use Cmd-A or Ctrl-A (depending on your operating system) to select all text on this page.``
| ``3. Right-click and select "Check".``
| ``4. Uncheck the boxes with non-spam changes, either by clicking on the check boxes or by selecting the boxes to uncheck and use CheckFox using right-click, "Uncheck".``
| ``5. Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click "delete checked".``
